                <p>Many organisations spend their resources on constantly updating <strong>Excel </strong>spreadsheets and <strong>PowerPoint </strong>slides, which are then used to inform decision-making at the higher levels. However, with the <strong>growing amount of data</strong> available and the need to get more fine-grained views of the data so as to answer more <strong>specific business questions</strong>, using tools such as Excel and PowerPoint becomes ungovernable.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cyrilby.github.io/mindgraph/media/posts/14/analytics-1925495_1280.png" alt="" width="273" height="204" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://cyrilby.github.io/mindgraph/media/posts/14/responsive/analytics-1925495_1280-xs.png 300w ,https://cyrilby.github.io/mindgraph/media/posts/14/responsive/analytics-1925495_1280-sm.png 480w ,https://cyrilby.github.io/mindgraph/media/posts/14/responsive/analytics-1925495_1280-md.png 768w"></figure>
<h2>Is it time to abandon the Excel/PowerPoint ship? üö¢</h2>
<p>Organisations have <strong>different maturity </strong>in terms of how they work with data, though there are likely very few organisations which do not make any use of data at all. More old-fashioned businesses or less tech-savvy teams may stick to using tools that can deliver some data-driven insights even if they do so at a <strong>great cost </strong>in terms of time and energy spent on generating those insights.</p>
<p>While it's positive that decisions are made based on data even if the tools used to inform those decisions are suboptimal, a <strong>great potential </strong>awaits those who are brave enough to venture into using tools that are more suitable for the job. In 2024, <strong>many such tools are available </strong>on the market: some of them are completely free, others are paid. Those tools commonly offer greater <strong>flexibility </strong>and <strong>scalability </strong>than Excel, not to mention they <strong>boost efficiency </strong>and minimise the likelihood of human errors impacting your conclusions.</p>
<h2>What does developing a modern report take? ‚õ≥</h2>
<p>To build a modern, interactive report that can be easily updated either automatically or upon request, it is not enough to have access to the data that will feed into the report and to know how to do the right calculations. Rather, the process requires taking a more <strong>holistic approach</strong> that starts and ends with making sure the <strong>end user's needs</strong> are met.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Designing a business intelligence (BI) solution may include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Building an ETL data pipeline and/or a data model to facilitate data import</li>
<li>Performing additional calculations to support data visualisation</li>
<li>Creating different data visualisations and adding different functionalities to the report (e.g. the ability to use filters and slicers on the data or change the metrics shown on the charts)</li>
<li>Designing and testing the user interface (UI) of the report in collaboration with end users</li>
<li>Documenting any calculations and assumptions made in the model</li>
<li>Onboarding end users to ensure they can make the best possible use of the new product</li>
</ul>
<p>Developing a modern, interactive report is an iterative process where the end user is involved in both the initial project scoping and the testing phases of the tool that's being designed.</p>
<h2>What technologies are fit for modern reporting? üèÖ</h2>
<p>The market of tools offering you quick, hassle-free ways of automating your reporting pipeline is quite saturated. On the one hand, you have <strong>industry standards</strong> such as Power BI, Tableau and Qlik Sense. These tools are considered to be easy to use both for developers and end users and they come with a lot of built-in functionality. Generally, they require a <strong>paid subscription</strong> to use or share reports within the rest of your organisation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a variety of <strong>free and open-source</strong> (FOSS) solutions exist. Examples include <strong>Shiny </strong>apps (R), <strong>Dash </strong>and <strong>Streamlit </strong>(Python). These tools have a steeper learning curve but offer more flexibility in terms of the look, feel and features of your reports and may offer lower costs than paid platforms (depending on the way you choose to deploy them). Ultimately, the choice between the two technology types is not clear-cut and will depend on your circumstances.</p>
<h2>Ready to get your first interactive report? üö£‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h2>
<p>If you would like to take the first step on <strong>revamping your reporting portfolio</strong> or <strong>troubleshoot </strong>and <strong>maintain </strong>existing interactive reports built using Power BI, Python or R, MindGraph can guide you through the process or do the actual development for you. Together, we can craft a <strong>draft version </strong>of a report, <strong>test</strong> it with end users, improve the tool based on their feedback and <strong>deploy</strong> it to the rest of the organisation.</p>
<p>If you believe the time is ripe to leave Excel and PowerPoint behind in favour of something modern, efficient and scalable, feel free to reach out to <a href="mailto:info@mindgraph.dk">info@mindgraph.dk</a> for a free, no-strings-attached 30 minutes meeting where we can discuss your needs in more detail.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>With so much data on our hands and a <strong>growing interest </strong>in utilising those data to their fullest potential, <strong>requests</strong> about new reports and analyses keep pouring in. <strong>Prioritising </strong>which tasks to work on may sound daunting but it is <strong>essential </strong>to ensure the success of your data/analytics project.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cyrilby.github.io/mindgraph/media/posts/13/work-8660318.svg" alt="" width="252" height="252"></figure>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why is project scoping important? üéØ</h2>
<p>Today, most organisations sit on top of <strong>vast amounts of data</strong>, some of which they use to maintain a competitive advantage, while others are used to ensure compliance with internal or external policies. In either case, the <strong>number of stakeholders is expanding</strong>, each one with their own <strong>agenda </strong>and <strong>expectations</strong>. It is easy to become overwhelmed by having to navigate the complex landscape of diverging priorities, especially when short on resources.</p>
<p>Therefore, to get the most out of your data project, it's important to ensure that your <strong>resources are well spent.</strong> When your project is clearly defined and you have agreed on a minimal viable product <strong>(MVP)</strong> with the receiver of your product, it's easier not to get lost in the details.</p>
<h2>Is project scoping relevant for you? üêù</h2>
<p>Whether it comes down to conducting a one-off analytics project, building a data pipeline or designing an interactive business intelligence solution, project scoping is highly relevant to ensure that you <strong>get the outcome you need</strong>. A lot of excellent analytics products end up being unused, typically because of their disconnect from the business and the people who are supposed to be used. If you don't want to <strong>risk spending</strong> your resources on something that doesn't generate value, clearly defining your project is a <strong>good place to start</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project scoping may be relevant for you if you're thinking of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Setting up a data extract, transform and load (ETL) pipeline</li>
<li>Designing a business intelligence (BI)/reporting solution</li>
<li>Running an analytics project involving either statistical analysis or machine learning (ML)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do you know you're on a good track? üé¢</h2>
<p>A <strong>well-defined project</strong> that has been approved by your stakeholders while at the same time being realistic in the context of your resources is always a good start. It's usually easy to guess whether you're off to a good start by evaluating your project's relevance, clearness and how involved your stakeholders are in it:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cyrilby.github.io/mindgraph/media/posts/13/Good-project-scoping-characteristics-2.svg" alt="" width="1280" height="800"></figure>
<p>A project with a clear and business-relevant scope that has your important stakeholders onboard is more likely to be successful in <strong>generating value </strong>for you and your organisation.</p>
<h2>Need help with scoping your project? üö£‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h2>
<p>If you have decided on <strong>investing in building </strong>a data/analytics tool, running an analysis to test your hypotheses or just <strong>exploring</strong> the potential of <strong>optimising</strong> your data set-up, MindGraph can <span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">help you translate your business needs into a project specification.

                <p>In today's world, we're surrounded by all sorts of systems and tools that generate data. These data contain a <strong>vast amount of information</strong>, which can help us understand important processes, confirm or disprove our beliefs or classify and predict outcomes.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cyrilby.github.io/mindgraph/media/posts/11/call-center-7040784.svg" alt="" width="259" height="229"></figure>
<h2>What is Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)? ü¶ñ</h2>
<p>A common challenge with transforming data into powerful insights is that the data often comes from <strong>different</strong> <strong>sources</strong> and in <strong>different</strong> <strong>formats</strong>, making it challenging to use as it is. This is where developing an <strong>Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)</strong> pipeline can come in handy. By linking data from different sources and transforming it according to rules relevant for your business, you can build a solid fundament for your reporting, business intelligence or statistical/machine learning modelling.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits of proper ETL pipelines? ‚ú®</h2>
<p>There are many ways in which having clean, well-structured and easily accessible data may benefit your organisation:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cyrilby.github.io/mindgraph/media/posts/11/Benefits-of-ETL-pipelines-2.svg" alt="" width="1280" height="800"></figure>
<p>Here's how having proper data collection and cleaning processes can bring value to your organisation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced decision making</strong>: clean data leads to more accurate analysis, which can improve decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>Improved operational efficiency</strong>: clean data can streamline business processes, removing redundancies and silo work and ensuring that a single source of truth is available in the organisation, leading to an increased efficiency reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Increased customer acquisition and retention</strong>: accurate data can help in better understanding the customers, leading to more effective marketing strategies and increased customer acquisition</li>
<li><strong>Improved talent acquisition and retention</strong>: similarly to product and customer data, data on your talent acquisition, employee experience, remuneration and career development can help you attract and retain the talent your organisation needs to perform at its best.</li>
<li><strong>Increased revenue</strong>: with improved decision-making and customer acquisition, companies can see an increase in revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Increased employee productivity</strong>: with access to clean and reliable data, employees can be more productive as they don‚Äôt have to spend time dealing with inaccurate data.</li>
<li><strong>Minimised waste of time and money</strong>: cleaning data helps in avoiding mistakes that could cost the company in terms of time and money.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, ETL and data cleaning are <strong>integral</strong> <strong>parts</strong> of handling data in any organisational context. They help to ensure that the data is <strong>accurate</strong>, <strong>reliable</strong>, and in a format that is <strong>easy to analyse</strong>, leading to more informed decision-making and improved business outcomes.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><strong>MindGraph covers a</strong> <strong>wide array of tasks</strong> ranging from data collection, transformation and analysis to presenting insights and onboarding users to interactive tools and reports. My unique experience has thought me the importance of <strong>relating data to a business context</strong> and designing products that are tailored to the end user's needs, also when that user is a non-technical person.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Below, you can read more about which <strong>areas MindGraph can help you </strong>in.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a href="https://cyrilby.github.io/mindgraph/project-scoping.html">Project scoping</a> üéØ</h2>
<p>Whether it comes down to conducting a one-off analytics project, building a data pipeline or designing an interactive business intelligence solution, I can help you <strong>translate your business needs</strong> into a project specification. Together, we can <strong>define the scope</strong> of the final product, estimate the resources needed to achieve your goal, <strong>identify</strong> <strong>opportunities</strong> for improvement and mitigate any potential risks.</p>

<h2><a href="https://cyrilby.github.io/mindgraph/building-etl-pipeline.html">Building an ETL data pipeline</a> ü™Ç</h2>
<p>To be able to transform data into powerful insights, it is necessary to set up a proper¬†<strong>Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)</strong> pipeline. By linking data from different sources and transforming it according to rules relevant for your business, you can <strong>build a solid fundament</strong> for your reporting, business intelligence or statistical/machine learning modelling, regardless of whether you use R, Python, Power Query or DAX.</p>

<h2><a href="https://cyrilby.github.io/mindgraph/designing-interactive-reports.html">Designing interactive (BI) reports</a> üìä</h2>
<p>The way to unlocking the potential of your data often starts with <strong>getting to know your data</strong> and what better way to understand your data than to visualise it in a way that's meaningful to your organisation?</p>
<p>Whether you want to track <strong>real-time metrics</strong> or follow important developments in quarterly or annual <strong>KPIs</strong>, identify difference between different categories of products, customers or employees, an <strong>interactive, automatically updated report</strong> can facilitate you in achieving your goals.</p>

<h2>Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing ‚öñÔ∏è</h2>
<p>While data visualisation is a great way to start exploring the potential of your data, a chart is seldom sufficient to tell you <strong>the story behind</strong> what you see on it. To dig deeper and ensure that the insights you're getting have a <strong>solid backing</strong>, it is often useful to do some sort of hypothesis testing or<strong> study the impact</strong> of different factors on the metric you're interested in explaining.</p>
<p>With the right kind of statistical analysis, you will not only be able to discern between apparent and real patterns but also <strong>measure important differences and effects</strong> observed in the data.</p>
<p><a href="#">Click here</a> to <strong>learn more</strong> about how statistical analysis can be used in practice to solve real-world problems.</p>
<h2>Building predictive statistical/ML models üîÆ</h2>
<p>Data-mature organisations use a mixture of approaches to <strong>extract the most value</strong> from their data and <strong>stay competitive</strong>. With the recent explosion in generative AI, the edge that applying methods more sophisticated than traditional statistical analysis has been getting the spotlight. In reality, both machine learning (ML) and traditional statistics can be useful when it comes to building predictive models.</p>
<p>The choice of whether to use one thing or the other will often depend on your circumstances, such as the quality and quantity of the data you have available. Either way, having a predictive model at your disposal can be a <strong>powerful tool</strong> to <strong>supercharge your decision-making</strong>.</p>

<h2>Onboarding and training of non-technical people üßë‚Äçüè´</h2>
<p>If you find yourself in a situation where either you or someone else in your company feels unable to use the outputs of your analytics/data science team, then you may benefit from a <strong>proper introduction </strong>to those tools and the concepts they build upon.</p>
<p>Whether you're interested in <strong>improving the data culture</strong> of your department, <strong>communicating </strong>your valuable insights in a more user-friendly way, <strong>onboarding users </strong>to interactive analytics tools or even getting to <strong>know the basics</strong> of modern data analytics and programming, MindGraph can support you on your journey.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Mission üéØ</h2>
<p>My mission is to contribute to a better world by <strong>facilitating a</strong> <strong>deeper understanding </strong>of the patterns and phenomena that shape our reality. I am committed to providing decision-makers with <strong>practical recommendations</strong> based on a solid data foundation. By harnessing my curiosity, dedication, and perseverance, I tackle real-world data challenges, extract meaningful insights, and communicate them in a user-friendly, accessible manner.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Vision üå±</h2>
<p>I envision a future where data-driven insights <strong>empower decision-makers</strong> at all levels, fostering informed choices that lead to a better, more equitable world. To arrive there, I believe we need to reshape the way working with data and analytics is perceived, transforming it from a complex, challenging endeavour into something <strong>more relatable and accessible</strong> for the average human being. Data-driven insights can help us change the world for the better - provided that we are all on board with the story the data is trying to tell us.</p>

Following my graduation, I've worked in both the <strong>public</strong> and the <strong>private sectors,</strong> where, I've been responsible for both data collection, transformation and analysis for over <strong>5 years</strong>. I've been a part of creating statistical and ML models to generate predictions and explain key relationships in the data, mostly through the use of R, Python and Excel. I enjoy the <strong>nerdy, back-end</strong> aspects of this process as much as the opportunity to <strong>engage with people</strong> so I can present and discuss the implications of my findings.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm motivated when I have the opportunity to <strong>contribute to something bigger</strong> and when I can see that others are benefiting from the fruits of my labour. I‚Äôm a huge supporter of a more data-driven approach both when it comes to our organizations, our society and ourselves as individuals.</p>

                <p>Do you know what the world‚Äôs happiest country is? (Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs somewhere in the Nordics.) Each year, the <strong>World Happiness Report</strong> (WHR) gives an account of the state of happiness around the world. More often than not, its findings are not that surprising: highly developed countries with stable political systems are on top, while poor and war-torn countries are relegated to the bottom.</p>
<p>In this project (which I worked on between April 2023 - January 2024), I delved into the data to explore how happiness scores have evolved over time and identify the key <strong>factors that impact national happiness</strong>. Then, I used this knowledge to predict countries‚Äô happiness scores for 2023-2024 before the WHR has even collected the data! Below, I present some of my findings but I strongly encourage you to download <a href="https://github.com/cyrilby/world-happiness/blob/17efb001436c478737697ff4894946f11250c43e/Insights%20presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my infographic</a> so as not to miss on any of the insights.</p>
<h2>Happiness is on a downwards trajectory</h2>
<p>People around the world are now less happy than they were roughly two decades ago, with global happiness showing a <strong>decline of 14%</strong> in the period 2005-2022, as shown on the chart below:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cyrilby.github.io/mindgraph/media/posts/2/Global-average-happiness-score-over-time.svg" alt="" width="570" height="354"></figure>
<p>The¬†<span style="font-weight: 400;">the </span><strong>largest decline </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">in happiness was observed in countries which have had very dire economic circumstances and/or military conflicts such as Afghanistan, Lebanon and Venezuela, while the </span><strong>largest improvement </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">was seen in several African and Eastern European countries.</span></p>
<h2>Happiness reflects development and governance</h2>
<p>National happiness is largely defined by how <strong>well developed</strong> and how <strong>well governed</strong> a country is. Accounting for various economic, political, social, environmental and health-related factors, it is possible to explain up to <strong>74%</strong> of the differences in happiness scores between countries over time.</p>
<p>I arrived at this conclusion by testing a series of ridge-regression models, where the best fitting model contained a total of <strong>27 factors</strong>.¬†<span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of these, the ones with the strongest </span><strong>relative impact</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on global happiness were GDP per capita, female unemployment rate, access to electricity, health expenditure per capita and corruption. Other factors with a sizeable effect on happiness are shown below:</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cyrilby.github.io/mindgraph/media/posts/2/Different-factors-and-their-relative-impact-on-happiness-1.svg" alt="" width="825" height="499"></figure>
<h2>Future happiness can be predicted accurately</h2>
<p>Over the past 17 years, Denmark has consistently ranked among the top 3 happiest countries, a feat it has achieved an impressive 16 times. Many of the other countries which appear on top of the list have also consistenly ranked high on happiness across time. Given these <strong>strong historical trends</strong>, I decided to explore how the state of happiness is going to look for in the next couple of years, assuming the underlying factors that determine national happiness remain unchanged.</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">To do so, I developed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a </span><strong style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">machine learning model</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (random forest) to generate the predictions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The model was trained on all years except for the most recent year with available </span><strong style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">happiness score</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2022) and was optimised to increase its accuracy. The input variables included in the model, which were selected based on the ridge regression analysis, did not originally have values in future time periods, so those were derived by projecting historical trends into the future. Assuming country-level </span><strong style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">historical trends</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remain valid in the forecasting period, the model should be able to predict national happiness scores with an </span><strong style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">accuracy of up to 96%</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">According to this model, the top 10 happiest countries in 2023 should be:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Finland (predicted happiness score: 7.65)</li>
<li>Denmark (7.61)</li>
<li>Switzerland (7.43*)</li>
<li>Iceland (7.43)</li>
<li>Norway (7.43)</li>
<li>Sweden(7.28)</li>
<li>Netherlands (7.27)</li>
<li>Luxembourg (7.17)</li>
<li>Austria (7.16)</li>
<li>New Zealand (7.05)</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Similarly, the top 10 happiest countries in 2024 should be:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Denmark (predicted happiness score: 7.62)</li>
<li>Finland (7.57)</li>
<li>Switzerland (7.40)</li>
<li>Iceland (7.38)</li>
<li>Norway (7.28)</li>
<li>Luxembourg (7.19)</li>
<li>Austria (7.15)</li>
<li>Netherlands (7.14)</li>
<li>Sweden (7.06)</li>
<li>Australia (7.02)</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, those are just projections based on the assumptions that historical trends for happiness score and its underlying factors will continue into the future. Therefor, it‚Äôll be exciting to see how accurate these predictions prove to be once the actual rankings are released!</p>

                <p>If you've ever been looking for a place to stay in the Greater Copenhagen area (Stork√∏benhavn), you probably know that <strong>the struggle is real</strong>. With limited supply and high pricing, finding an accommodation can be a challenging task. Prompted by my personal curiousity on the subject, I decided to look into the data to figure out what is generally available for rent, how much it costs as well as which factors influence the price. In this article, I would like to share some of my findings with you, though I encourage you to download <a href="https://github.com/cyrilby/BoligPortal-insights/blob/573ac0bedd439ee9db3b8e867efcf1b693209ba7/Insights%20presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my infographic</a> to get all insights.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Please note that the conclusions and recommendations presented below are as of <strong>February</strong> <strong>2023</strong>. While I expect these to remain more or less stable due to the structural character of the rental market, some changes may occur.</p>
<h2>What's available on the market?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This analysis is based on advertisements scapred from the Danish website <a href="http://www.boligportal.dk">www.boligportal.dk</a>, where landlords post about accommodations they have available for rent. These can range from single rooms to apartments and houses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 21 February 2023, there were just over </span><strong>3,000</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong>rentals listed </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the Greater Copenhagen area (<em>Stork√∏benhavn</em> in Danish)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The vast majority of these were apartments (82%) and single rooms (12%). Rooms were mostly </span><strong>located </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the city (‚Öî of all rooms), while houses were mostly located in the suburbs (92% of all houses).</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other things worth noting include:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, </span><strong>73% of all </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">accommodations were available for rent for an </span><strong>unlimited time period</strong>.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to </span><strong>size</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, regular houses are the rental type with the largest </span><strong>median area</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (153 m¬≤), followed by semi-detached houses (120 m¬≤) and apartments (87 m¬≤).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we measure size by the median </span><strong>number of rooms </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">instead, the conclusion is pretty similar, with houses leading (5 rooms), followed by semi-detached (4 rooms) and apartments (3 rooms).</span></li>
<li>Apartments were the type of accommodation most likely to be associate with an <strong>unlimited lease duration</strong>, while houses were least likely to be available for an unlimited time period, as the chart below shows:</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not sure what‚Äôs reasonable to pay for rent?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the price of</span><strong> rent per square meter</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we see that for the vast majority of accommodations, you‚Äôd be expected to pay between </span><strong>150-200 kr.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per m¬≤. That being said, in some cases the price can be as low as 67 kr. per m¬≤ or as high as 894 kr. per m¬≤. In 75% of all cases, you can furthermore expect to pay below 13.22 kr. per m¬≤ in relation to the monthly fixed <strong>acconto</strong> payment.</span></p>
<p>Please note that rent prices differ based on both geographical location and the type of accommodation, as can be seen on the chart below:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cyrilby.github.io/mindgraph/media/posts/3/Median-rent-per-square-meter-by-rental-type.svg" alt="" width="597" height="316"></figure>
<h2>Wonder how to save money on rent?</h2>
<p>You can use several strategies here. You can either go for a smaller place (if you want to save in absolute terms) or a bigger place (if you want to save in relative terms, given that the price of rent per m¬≤ decreases with size). You can also choose a less central location, for example, by opting not to live in Copenhagen or Frederiksberg, you can save 53 kr. per m¬≤ on average.</p>
<h2>Want to live alone?</h2>
<p>If you are single or you just want to live by yourself, then<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>you might be better off by renting a one-room apartment<span style="font-weight: 400;"> (e.g. a studio) rather than going for a single room in a shared accommodation. Based on median price, <strong>one-room apartments are </strong></span><strong>43% cheaper</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> than single rooms</strong>. In fact, if we look at the bottom 75% of all one-room apartments, prices will not exceed 245 kr. per square meter, whereas if we look at the bottom 75% of all single rooms, the price per square meter can be as high as 463 kr. (a difference of 89%).</span></p>
<p>These are insights from my latest spare time project, where I looked into data on 3,000+ privately rented accommodations from the Danish website BoligPortal. You can read more about the project in the linked infographic and go in-depth with the analysis on my GitHub page.</p>
